The Ethiopian Students Association International (ESAI) was founded in the summer of 1999 by Wubeshet Mehari at Marymount University. Initially, ESAI was created with the goal of bringing the Ethiopian Students in North America and all over the world together to build a strong bond between students and the Ethiopian community.  Wubeshet worked with different Ethiopian Student Associations in and around the Washington, DC area to bring his vision of ESAI alive. Today, ESAI has broadened its mission to include helping Ethiopian students to make progress academically and improving the lives of Ethiopians as two additional missions on top of creating a networking environment between Ethiopian students and professionals. Below is a video documentary of how ESAI began, enjoy!

Some of the programs and events ESAI has or will create are scholarship opportunities, seminars, a database of Ethiopian professionals and jobs, guides to resources to study outside of Ethiopia (and resources within Ethiopia), and many more. We envision to be the primary source of informaiton, collaboration, and socialization point for Ethiopian students all over the world. Through many of the tools in our website, we will provide information pertaining to the needs of our members. We will give them the tools they need to work with other members on a variety of projects for ESAI and Ethiopia. And lastly, we will provide the tools and setting for them to socialize with other members and professionals.
    
ESAI has members in North America (all over the US and Canada), Europe, Africa and Asia at approximately 4,000 members, with a few hundred active members.
